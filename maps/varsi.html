				This view by Varsi is taken from the Gianiculum Hill looking east over Rome. The pinpoints here are restricted to Ridealâ€™s signature floating cloth works. The city is depicted with its layers of history represented by a mass of architectural constructions and ruins against the bare hills indicated beyond. We can recognize the peaks of Monte Soratte and those of Capraola, Monterosi and Monterotondo further east . Using these landmarks we can makes further connections with the maps showing the broader Lazio region.
